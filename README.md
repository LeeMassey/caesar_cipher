Just a simple Caesar Cipher generator.

I originally made a caesar cipher generator that worked only in the console for part of The Odin Project.

I decided to make a UI to practice layout with CSS, primarily using CSS flexboxes, and also modified the Javascript so anyone can check it out without having to open up the developer console.
